# Vortex Extension for Starfield

This is an extension for [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) to add support for Starfield. This is available for the PC on [Xbox & Game Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/starfield) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/).

# Features

# Installation

This extension requires Vortex 1.8.5 or greater. To install, click the Vortex button at the top of the page to open this extension within Vortex, and then click Install.

You can also manually install it by downloading the main file and dragging it into the drop target labelled Drop File(s) in the Extensions page at the bottom right.

Afterwards, restart Vortex and you can begin installing supported Starfield mods with Vortex.

# Game detection

The Starfield game extension enables Vortex to automatically locate installs from the Steam and Xbox apps.

It is also possible to manually set the game folder if the auto detection doesn't find the correct installation. A valid Starfield game folder contains:

- `Starfield.exe`

If your game lacks these files/folders then it is likely that your installation has become corrupted somehow.

# Mod Management

By default, Vortex will deploy files to the game's root folder and extracts the archive while preserving the folder structure.
